Erosion And Dilation Algorithms from scratch.

- Erosion and Dilation are two important techniques that are used a alot in image processing steps, Erosion is used to make the object smaller while dilation is used to make the object larger.

- you can see in the code their implementation which will open your eyes to a lot of other algorithms and how they perform on images.
